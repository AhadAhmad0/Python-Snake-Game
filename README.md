# Python-Snake-Game

🐍 Snake Game in Python:
📌 Project Overview:

This repository contains a classic Snake Game built in Python, designed to bring back the nostalgic arcade experience in a simple and fun way. The project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, collision detection, event handling, and score tracking, making it a great starting point for beginners and an engaging project for intermediate learners.

The snake moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself or the game boundaries. The player’s score increases with each piece of food eaten, and the challenge intensifies as the snake grows longer and faster.

🚀 Features:

1.🎮 Simple and intuitive gameplay

2.⌨️ Keyboard controls for movement

3.🧩 Dynamic snake growth and score tracking

4.🎨 Colorful graphics with smooth animations

5.⚡ Increasing difficulty as the game progresses

🛠️ Technologies Used:

1.Python 3.x

2.Pygame library for graphics, animation, and event handling

🎯 Learning Outcomes:

1.This project helps in understanding:

2.Game loops and event handling

3.Collision detection techniques

4.Scoreboard logic and UI rendering

5.Using external libraries in Python projects
